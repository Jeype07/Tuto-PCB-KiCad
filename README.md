# Tuto-PCB-KiCad

These are the results of a small tutorial on how to make a PCB using the sofware Kicad 8 (Schematics and Routing).
We are going to build a PCB around the microcontroller  STM32G431KBT6 (not available in Kicad libraries), supplied by a USB port to enable the communication with a PC.
